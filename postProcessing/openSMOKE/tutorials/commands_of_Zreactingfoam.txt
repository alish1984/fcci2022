# - Make/files


# case setup modifications:
# you need schemes for divergence of Z --- > div(phi,Z)          Gauss limitedLinear01 1;
# you need a solver for Z --- > |epsilon|Z ...
# you need Z in 0 folder ---> let's use duplicate Ydefault but we need proper BC (see preProcessing)
# Z_pilot = 0.04207 
# Z_jet = 0.15551
# Z_air = 0.0

# you may also want to change the setFields if you want to be precise! 

# rememebr to add Z into the 0.org folder 

# !!!! MAKE SURE YOU CHANGE THE Allrun FILE (see controlDict) !!!!
